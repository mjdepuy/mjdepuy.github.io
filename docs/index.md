# Hello world!
### My name is Michael Depuy
I am creating this site for a couple reasons:

1. Inspired by the community to give back, I would love to share tools, techniques, and knowledge about malware analysis, forensics, reverse engineering, and threat analysis. 
2. To improve my knowledge about the aforementioned topics and to have a project page for interested parties to look at.

If you are coming to this page looking for guru-level advice, you may not find it here as I am no guru. There are many others in this field more capable than myself. Beyond that, welcome, and I hope you enjoy the posts.

I did maintain a site on Blogspot, but that has been decomissioned. Post that used to reside there are now here. At the time of writing this intro, GitHub pages is new to me, so I apologize for using a default template. :)
